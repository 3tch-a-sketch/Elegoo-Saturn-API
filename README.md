# Elegoo-Saturn-API
As Elegoo doesn't seem to offer any API for the saturn this is a home-made version from snooping traffic from Chitubox with Wireshark. This will also likely work with other printers that use the CBD control board but I'm unable to test this.

This will lated be updated with some examples and description of how the saturn expects commands to be sent.
